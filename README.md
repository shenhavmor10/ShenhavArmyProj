How to open - 
1. run the testServer2 exe
2. run the gui exe
3. write in the gui sections - *file *projectFolder *gcc *any other folder that you included from. (for now you have to supply all of the four last one needs to be optional but i didnt make it optional yet.)

program isnt close to be finished.. for now i have the compile check in the run of the program.
the rest api does work but it needs to get requests in order for it to work and at the moment i found a way to connect between the tools and platform .
i will tell you about it in sunday. after ill finish the idea i will have a fully run of the program but obviously most of the things are not finished.
